TorrentJS
=========

A WIP mobile interface for the Transmission torrent daemon, with XBMC integration.

I wrote this mostly to learn Node.js and Backbone and do something interesting on my Raspberry Pi.

To use this app, you will need to install:

XBMC
Node.js
Transmission

XBMC and Transmission config options to follow.

Add your server details to config/appConfig.js

Run:

node server.js

Or start it via forever.
